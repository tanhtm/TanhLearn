    "# 1. Components Involved in Blockchain Project Development\n",
    "The entire blockchain project development consists of three major components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Client\n",
    "- Miners\n",
    "- Blockchain\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Client\n",
    "The Client is the one who will buy goods from other vendors. The client himself may become a vendor and will accept money from others against the goods he supplies. We assume here that the client can both be a supplier and a recipient of TPCoins. Thus, we will create a client class in our code that has the ability to send and receive money.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Miner\n",
    "The Miner is the one who picks up the transactions from a transaction pool and assembles them in a block. The miner has to provide a valid proof-of-work to get the mining reward. All the money that miner collects as a fee will be for him to keep. He may spend that money on buying goods or services from other registered vendors on the network, just the way a Client described above does.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Blockchain\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a Blockchain is a data structure that chains all the mined blocks in a chronological order. This chain is immutable and thus temper-proof.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may follow this tutorial by typing out the code presented in each step in a new Jupyter notebook. Alternatively, you may download the entire Jupyter notebook from www.anaconda.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter, we will develop a client that uses our blockchain system.\n"

    "# 2. Python Blockchain - Developing Client\n",
    "\n",
    "A client is somebody who holds TPCoins and transacts those for goods/services from other vendors on the network including his own. We should define a Client class for this purpose. To create a globally unique identification for the client, we use PKI (Public Key Infrastructure).\n",
    "\n",
    "The client should be able to send money from his wallet to another known person. Similarly, the client should be able to accept money from a third party. For spending money, the client would create a transaction specifying the sender’s name and the amount to be paid. For receiving money, the client will provide his identity to the third party − essentially a sender of the money. We do not store the balance amount of money the client holds in his wallet. During a transaction, we will compute the actual balance to ensure that the client has sufficient balance to make the payment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To develop the Client class and for the rest of the code in the project, we will need to import many Python libraries. These are listed below "
